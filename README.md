This research endeavor, conducted by __Dr. John LaRocco__, __Dr. Qudsia Tahmina__, and __John Simonis__ at The Ohio State University, is dedicated to the development of a novel method for reading printer .gcode files and converting them into actual printable models for physical storage. Specifically, the primary objective of this project is to construct a system that can represent data in 8-bit integers and 16-bit floats with a common database to construct a physical print in place model using new Arc Overhangs.

## Requirements

### Software
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [PrusaSlicer]( https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/) or other slicer
```pip install pandas numpy openpyxl trimesh[easy]```

### Hardware
- 3D-Printer

## <a id="models"></a>Models & Construction
For this project, all pertinent 3D models are to be generated by the user using the program in the [GG_Builder](https://github.com/Multi-Volt/GreyGoo/tree/PrintableProgram/GG-Builder) directory.
To run the program ensure that all of the files are unpacked and present in the same folder to run the program simply open the directory in a terminal instance and type ```python GG_Builder.py```.
Currently the program supports custom gcode files but also comes with a default coin file designed for the common Ender 3 Pro 3D printer.

### Details
This project will create multiple printable sections of the desired gcode program by referencing all values with a common excel database. Commands are selected via a reference number stored in an unsigned 8-bit integer container. All other values are represented as 16-bit floats.
